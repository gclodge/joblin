## Overview

`joblin` is a .NET-based, minimally viable, asynchronous worker management service.  Users can configure & add the business logic they need scheduled, managed, rate-limited, or otherwise executed & tracked with horizontal scalability.

Further - being a consistent & declarative framework it should allow users to quickly populate the remaining business logic using AI agent assistance.
